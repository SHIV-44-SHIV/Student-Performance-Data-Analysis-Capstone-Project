# 🎓 Student Performance Data Analysis Capstone Project

This project is a complete end-to-end data analysis case study focused on understanding student academic performance using Python, SQL, and Power BI.

## 📌 Objective
To analyze a real-world dataset of student scores in various subjects, uncover patterns and correlations using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), SQL queries, and visualize the findings using Power BI dashboards.


## 🧰 Tools & Technologies
- Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- MySQL / SQLite (SQL Queries)
- Power BI (Interactive Visual Dashboards)
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📂 Dataset
The dataset contains student performance records with the following attributes:
- Gender
- Ethnicity
- Parental Level of Education
- Test Preparation Course
- Scores in Math, Reading, and Writing


## 🔍 Project Workflow

### 1. Data Loading & Preprocessing (Python)
- Loaded the CSV dataset
- Cleaned missing or inconsistent data
- Standardized column names

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (Python)
- Analyzed distributions and trends across gender, test prep, and parental education
- Visualized data using bar plots, histograms, and correlation heatmaps

### 3. SQL-Based Insights
- Imported cleaned data into SQL database
- Ran SQL queries to analyze average scores, top performers, subject-wise stats
- Joined tables and filtered data with multiple conditions

### 4. Power BI Dashboard
- Loaded SQL output into Power BI
- Created interactive dashboards:
  - Subject-wise performance by gender
  - Score distribution across test preparation status
  - Parental education vs. student performance


## 📊 Key Insights
- Students who completed test prep scored higher on average.
- Female students showed stronger performance in Reading and Writing.
- Parental education level has a noticeable effect on student scores.
